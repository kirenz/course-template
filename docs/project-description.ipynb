    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**TL;DR**: *Pick a data set and do a regression analysis. That is your final project.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the final project is for you to use regression analysis to analyze a data set of your own choosing.\n",
    "The data set may already exist or you may collect your own data by scraping the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the data based on your group's interests or work you all have done in other courses or research projects.\n",
    "The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like!) and apply them to a data set to analyze it in a meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "All analyses must be done in RStudio, and all components of the project **must be reproducible** (with the exception of the presentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "You will work on the project with your lab groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four primary deliverables for the final project are\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A written, reproducible report detailing your analysis\n",
    "-   A GitHub repository corresponding to your report\n",
    "-   Slides + a video presentation\n",
    "-   Formal peer review on another team's project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topic ideas {#topic-ideas}\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify 2-3 data sets you're interested in potentially using for the final project.\n",
    "If you're unsure where to find data, you can use the list of potential data sources in the [Tips + Resources](#tips--resources) section as a starting point.\n",
    "It may also help to think of topics you're interested in investigating and find data sets on those topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of submitting project ideas is to give you time to find data for the project and to make sure you have a data set that can help you be successful in the project.\n",
    "**Therefore, you must use one of the data sets submitted as a topic idea, unless otherwise notified by the teaching team.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data sets should meet the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   At least 500 observations\n",
    "\n",
    "-   At least 10 columns\n",
    "\n",
    "-   At least 6 of the columns must be useful and unique predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Identifier variables such as \"name\", \"social security number\", etc. are not useful predictor variables.\n",
    "    -   If you have multiple columns with the same information (e.g. \"state abbreviation\" and \"state name\"), then they are not unique predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   At least one variable that can be identified as a reasonable response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The response variable can be quantitative or categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A mix of quantitative and categorical variables that can be used as predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Observations should reasonably meet the independence condition.\n",
    "    Therefore, avoid data with repeated measures, data collected over time, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You may not use data that has previously been used in any course materials, or any derivation of data that has been used in course materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please ask a member of the teaching team if you're unsure whether your data set meets the criteria.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each data set, include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction and data\n",
    "\n",
    "-   State the source of the data set.\n",
    "-   Describe when and how it was originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data)\n",
    "-   Describe the observations and the general characteristics being measured in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research question\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Describe a research question you're interested in answering using this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Glimpse of data\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Use the `glimpse` function to provide an overview of each data set\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit the PDF of the topic ideas to Gradescope.\n",
    "Mark all pages associated with each data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project proposal {#project-proposal}\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the project proposal is to help you think about your analysis strategy early.\n",
    "\n",

    "Critically reviewing others' work is a crucial part of the scientific process, and STA 210 is no exception.\n",
    "Each lab team will be assigned two other teams's projects to review.\n",
    "Each team should push their draft to their GitHub repo by the due date.\n",
    "One lab in the following week will be dedicated to the peer review, and all reviews will be due by the end of that lab session.\n",
    "\n",

    "-   Content - What is the quality of research and/or policy question and relevancy of data to those questions?\n",
    "-   Correctness - Are statistical procedures carried out and explained correctly?\n",
    "-   Writing and Presentation - What is the quality of the statistical presentation, writing, and explanations?\n",
    "-   Creativity and Critical Thought - Is the project carefully thought out? Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project?\n",

    "-   *90%-100%*: Outstanding effort. Student understands how to apply all statistical concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument, can identify weaknesses in the argument, and can clearly communicate the results to others.\n",
    "-   *80%-89%*: Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of their argument, and communicates most results clearly to others.\n",
    "-   *70%-79%*: Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication of results is sometimes unclear.\n",
    "-   *60%-69%*: Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication of results is unclear.\n",
    "-   *Below 60%*: Student is not making a sufficient effort.\n",
