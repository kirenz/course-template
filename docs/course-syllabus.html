<h2>Lectures and labs<a class="headerlink" href="#lectures-and-labs" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The goal of both the lectures and the labs is for them to be as interactive as possible.
My role as instructor is to introduce you new tools and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them.
A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing.
Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab.
You are expected to attend all lecture and lab sessions and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion.
Additionally, some lectures will feature [application exercises] that will be graded.
In addition to application exercises will be periodic activities help build a learning community.
These will be short, fun activities that will help everyone in the class connect throughout the semester.</p>
<p>You are expected to bring a laptop to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises.
Please make sure your laptop is fully charged before you come to class as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone.
More information on loaner laptops can be found <a class="reference external" href="https://keeplearning.duke.edu/technical-support/">here</a>.</p>

<section id="teams">
<h2>Teams<a class="headerlink" href="#teams" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>You will be assigned to a team at the beginning of the semester.
You are encouraged to sit with your teammates in lecture and you will also work with them in the lab sessions.
All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of the labs and project and you will be asked to evaluate your team members throughout the semester.
Failure to adequately contribute to an assignment will result in a penalty to your mark relative to the team’s overall mark.</p>
<p>You are expected to make use of the provided GitHub repository as their central collaborative platform.
Commits to this repository will be used as a metric (one of several) of each team member’s relative contribution for each project.</p>
</section>
<section id="assessment">
<h2>Assessment<a class="headerlink" href="#assessment" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Assessment for the course is comprised of six components: application exercises, homework assignments, labs, exams, projects, and teamwork.</p>
<section id="application-exercises">
<h3>Application exercises<a class="headerlink" href="#application-exercises" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Parts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs).
These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures.
These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period.
Specifically, AEs from Tuesday lectures are due Friday by 11:59 pm ET, and AEs from Thursday lectures are due Sunday by 11:59 pm ET.</p>
<p>Because these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts.
Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.</p>
</section>
<section id="labs">
<h3>Labs<a class="headerlink" href="#labs" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>In labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation.
Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment.
You are expected to use the team’s GitHub repository on the course’s GitHub organization as the central platform for collaboration.
Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration.
Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.</p>
<p><em>The lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="homework">
<h3>Homework<a class="headerlink" href="#homework" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>In homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks.
You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually.
Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.</p>
<p>One homework assignment will be dedicated to a <em>statistics experience</em>.
The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities.
As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.</p>
<p><em>The lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="exams">
<h3>Exams<a class="headerlink" href="#exams" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>There will be three, take-home, open-note exams.
Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far.
The exams will focus on the conceptual understanding of the content, and they may also include small analysis and computational tasks.
The content of the exam will be related to the content in the prepare, practice, and perform assignments.
More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.</p>

<section id="project">
<h3>Project<a class="headerlink" href="#project" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of the <span class="xref myst">project</span> is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting, data-driven research question.
The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period.

<h2>Five tips for success<a class="headerlink" href="#five-tips-for-success" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Your success on this course depends very much on you and the effort you put into it.
The course has been organized so that the burden of learning is on you.
Your TAs and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Complete all the preparation work before class.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the readings.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won’t know where to begin asking questions. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours, and let me help you identify a good (re)starting point.</p></li>

More details on Trinity attendance policies are available <a class="reference external" href="https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/class-attendance-and-missed-work">here</a>.</p>
<p>However, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day, particularly with possible extra personal and academic stress and health concerns this semester.
All course lectures will be recorded and available to enrolled students after class.
If you miss a lecture, make sure to watch the recording and review the material before the next class session.
Lab time is dedicated to working on your lab assignments and collaborating with your teammates on your project.
If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your team about how you can make up your contribution.
Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously.
If you know you’re going to miss a lab session and you’re feeling well enough to do so, notify your teammates ahead of time.
Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others’ time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.</p>

<h3>Attendance policy related to COVID symptoms, exposure, or infection<a class="headerlink" href="#attendance-policy-related-to-covid-symptoms-exposure-or-infection" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Student health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities.
To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have symptoms related to COVID-19, have had a known exposure to COVID-19, or have tested positive for COVID-19.
If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols.
If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health at 919-681-9355.
To keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines.
Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.</p>

<h3>Inclement weather policy<a class="headerlink" href="#inclement-weather-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>In the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work.
This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously or watching a recording of the class.</p>

<section id="policy-on-video-recording-course-content">
<h3>Policy on video recording course content<a class="headerlink" href="#policy-on-video-recording-course-content" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>All lectures will be recorded and available on <a class="reference external" href="https://duke.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%22d6c1d58a-cb6d-4732-9d4b-ae0c011bf767%22">Panopto</a>, so students should not need to create their own recordings of lectures.
If you feel that you need record the lectures yourself, you must get permission from me ahead of time and these recordings should be used for personal study only, no for distribution.
The full policy on recording of lectures falls under the Duke University Policy on Intellectual Property Rights, available at <a class="reference external" href="https://provost.duke.edu/sites/default/files/FHB_App_P.pdf">provost.duke.edu/sites/default/files/FHB_App_P.pdf</a>.
Unauthorized distribution is a cause for disciplinary action by the Judicial Board.</p>

<p>I want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class.
If this requires flexibility, please don’t hesitate to ask.</p>

<li><p>You <em>never</em> owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you’re always welcome to talk to me.
If I can’t help, I likely know someone who can.</p></li>
